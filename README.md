The maritime industry is the backbone of global trade with more than 80% of the trade volume transported by sea. The safety and the efficiency of the maritime trade suffer from maritime disasters, mainly due to human errors. Therefore, accurate and effective communication in the maritime industry is critical for safety and operational efficiency. Automatic Speech Recognition systems can facilitate better maritime communication. However, an open-source Automatic Speech Recognition training dataset in this domain is not available and creating such a dataset containing the chatter and its audio requires significant amount of manual effort. Creating this dataset can be achieved by using a Large Language Model to generate maritime chatters and a Text-to-Speech model to create the audio data. To address the problem of data shortage, Llama 3.1 8B model is used to augment an existing manually created dataset of radio chatter instances with an adaptation of the [Self-Instruct method](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.10560) developed by Wang et. al(2023). Afterwards, the model is fine-tuned with the augmented dataset using Low-Rank Adaptation and prompt-tuning. Results prove that Large Language Models can be fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation and prompt-tuning to generate realistic and unique maritime radio chatters that comply with the regulations defined in [IMO Standard Maritime Communication Phrases](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/OurWork/Safety/Documents/A.918(22).pdf). Additionally, four evaluation metrics are proposed to assess the correctness of the format, information accuracy, logical coherence and the uniqueness of the maritime distress calls.

Source code is to be added later.
